### U.S. Pollution Analysis Dashboard

**Project Overview:**

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of air pollution levels across various counties and states in the U.S. between 2006 and 2010. The key pollutants visualized include Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Through interactive filters and visual representations, users can explore pollution levels at granular geographic and temporal scales, along with key insights regarding pollutant distribution.

**Key Features:**
1. **Interactive Data Selection:**
   - Users can filter pollution data by county, state, pollutant type, and time range.
   - Geographic mapping of pollution concentration helps identify highly affected areas.
   
2. **Pollutant Bifurcation & Distribution:**
   - A pie chart displays the quarterly distribution of pollution levels for each pollutant.
   - Dynamic bar charts highlight the maximum Air Quality Index (AQI) values by state, allowing users to compare pollution severity.

3. **Detailed Ozone Analysis:**
   - A separate page is dedicated to Ozone (O3) analysis, displaying its AQI levels, affected regions, and highest concentrations.
   - A line graph shows the trend of O3 AQI over the selected period, offering insights into yearly changes in pollution levels.
   - City-specific data, such as Mexicali (highest O3 AQI), is highlighted, providing a focused view of critical pollution points.

**Data Sources:**
The dataset used in this dashboard includes pollution statistics from official air quality monitoring systems across U.S. states, offering a comprehensive overview of pollution levels across different pollutants.

**Insights:**
- **Quarterly Bifurcation:** Pollution levels vary significantly between quarters, with certain pollutants like Ozone peaking during specific times of the year.
- **State Comparisons:** States such as California and North Carolina exhibited higher pollution levels, particularly in Ozone AQI.
- **Pollutant Impact:** The dashboard provides an overview of how each pollutant impacts different regions, allowing for targeted environmental interventions.

**User Experience:**
This dashboard is designed to be intuitive and interactive, enabling users to seamlessly navigate through the data and extract meaningful insights. It provides clear, visually appealing representations of pollution patterns, making it a valuable tool for environmental analysis and decision-making.
